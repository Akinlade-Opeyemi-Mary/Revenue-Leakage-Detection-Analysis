# REVENUE LEAKAGE DETECTION ANALYSIS
## Executive Summary
FinSecure Technologies is a subscription-based financial technology (SaaS) company generating revenue through monthly plans, paid features, and customer upgrades. Despite steady customer activity, the company experienced a noticeable gap between expected and actual revenue.

This analysis was conducted to identify where revenue losses were occurring, uncover the underlying causes, and recommend data-driven actions to recover lost revenue and improve long-term profitability.

Using Excel, Power Pivot, and DAX, multiple dashboards were developed to analyze revenue leakage patterns, billing and payment risks, customer monetization gaps, and customer lifetime value behavior.

The findings revealed that revenue leakage was primarily driven by discount practices, under-monetized customer usage, and billing inefficiencies. Strategic actions were identified to strengthen pricing governance, stabilize billing operations, improve customer retention, and unlock revenue growth within the existing customer base.

## Company Overview

FinSecure Technologies is a financial technology (fintech) company operating under a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) business model. The company provides digital payment solutions and subscription-based financial services to businesses and individual customers.

Revenue is generated through recurring monthly subscription plans, premium feature add-ons, and customer upgrades across multiple service tiers, including Basic, Enterprise, and Premium plans.

As a subscription-driven organization, FinSecure’s financial performance depends heavily on pricing accuracy, billing efficiency, customer usage behavior, and long-term retention. Any breakdown across these areas can lead to revenue leakage and reduced profitability, making continuous revenue monitoring and optimization critical to business sustainability.

## Business Challenges

FinSecure Technologies faced several interconnected challenges that limited its ability to fully realize expected revenue despite active customer subscriptions.

Key challenges identified include:

- **Revenue Leakage:**  
  A persistent gap between expected and actual revenue indicated losses occurring within existing operations rather than from customer acquisition.

- **Excessive Discounting:**  
  Inconsistent and poorly governed discount practices reduced realized revenue across all subscription tiers.

- **Billing and Payment Inefficiencies:**  
  Billing errors, failed payments, and delayed collections resulted in uncollected revenue and increased cash-flow risk.

- **Under-Monetized Customers:**  
  A portion of customers paid for subscription plans but did not fully utilize premium features, limiting monetization potential.

- **Short Subscription Duration and Churn:**  
  Early cancellations and short-term subscriptions reduced customer lifetime value and long-term revenue stability.

- **Limited Visibility Into Revenue Drivers:**  
  Prior to analysis, the company lacked centralized insight into where revenue losses were occurring and which factors contributed most to leakage.

These challenges collectively weakened revenue efficiency and highlighted the need for a data-driven approach to identify root causes and guide corrective business actions.
